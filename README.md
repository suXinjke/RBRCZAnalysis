# RBR CZ Analysis

This repo hosts the source of [Richard Burns Rally Czech analysis](https://suxinjke.github.io/rbrcz_analysis).

Since it's beginnings in 2005, over **120 000** tournaments have been hosted, with over **34 000 000** stage results made by over **27 000** drivers.

This project was made out frustation: [RBR CZ](https://rbr.onlineracing.cz/) does not provide [records grouped by physics](https://rbr.onlineracing.cz/index.php?act=tstats&type=1). This gave an incentive to practice web scraping, parsing and data analysis to extract rather interesting info and share it with the community.
